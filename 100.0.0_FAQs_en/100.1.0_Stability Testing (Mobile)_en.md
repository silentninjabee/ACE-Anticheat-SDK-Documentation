## Reasons for Test

We are committed to continuously improving the compatibility and stability of the ACE solution, which has been proven reliable in many blockbuster games; however, as the solution is closely related to the system and hardware, any problems such as maloperation and difference in software/hardware environments may cause game faults.

## Testing Stage

You should pay special attention to the game stability after using the basic anti-cheat SDK and reinforcement solution on the game.Therefore, we recommend you focus on the game stability in the following two stages:

### Stage 1. After game reinforcement

After game reinforcement and before release, you should run the game on mainstream device models to test the game stability.

### Stage 2. After game release

After a game version is released, you should promptly check relevant information such as reported crash data and ANR error data. If a high proportion of crashes or ANR errors are related to the anti-cheat SDK or reinforcement solution, please contact the customer service in time.
