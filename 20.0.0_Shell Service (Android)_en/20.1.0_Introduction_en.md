## Overview of Shell Service Solution (Android)

Shell Service Solution is a rare game-dedicated shell in the market and is tailored based on mobile game applications' characteristics. It protects game security by combating game cheats and cracked games while ensuring a stable performance.<br/>
Shell Service Solution aims to become a **shell most suitable for games** since the development stage. During its design, its impact on the game performance is thoroughly considered and tested.<br/>
As its version iterates quickly, Shell Service Solution has formed a comprehensive feature matrix covering static code protection, runtime dependency, and resource protection and struck a balance between game performance and stability, making it a truly **game-dedicated shell**.<br/>
To meet the requirements of different users and cover different reinforcement scenarios, Shell Service Solution provides two reinforcement modes: **web-based reinforcement and command line-based reinforcement**<font color="#dd0000">(recommended)</font> (they will be detailed in subsequent documents).

## Strengths of Shell Service Solution (Android)

### Strength 1. Comprehensive features

The shell provides comprehensive protection for games in the aspects of **static code, runtime dependency, and resources**. Specifically, it offers the following features: function and variable protection, decompilation protection, secondary packaging prevention, anti-debugging, memory dump prevention, native runtime dependency, C# runtime dependency, game integrity check, .so file encryption and protection, .dll file encryption and protection, and resource fingerprint verification.

### Strength 2. Difficult stripping

It is important that the shell has powerful features; however, once the shell is stripped, all efforts will be in vain. Shell Service Solution comprehensively improves its coupling and **enhances the runtime dependencies (including native and .dll runtime dependencies) of the security components to further increase the stripping difficulty.** If it is discovered that a cheat writer replaces a local .so file or a code file such as .so and .dll files of the runtime, the game will be immediately forced to quit. The anti-stripping idea used in the shell is innovative and pioneering, outperforming many mainstream reinforcement solutions in the market.

### Strength 3. Strong resource protection for strict prevention against cracked games

The shell protects game resources in an all-around manner. Once a cheat writer performs operations on any game resources such as addition, deletion, or modification, the shell will immediately make the game quit.

### Strength 4. Low performance consumption and small impact on game performance

The shell minimizes the memory utilization and cracking time to take over game launch as early as possible. It can immediately initialize the shell code after game launch to construct a secure sandbox environment.

### Strength 5. High compatibility with mainstream device models in the market

To minimize the impact of Android fragmentation, Shell Service Solution interacts with the system underlying layer as less as possible and has high fault tolerance for security logic processing, ensuring compatibility with a large number of device models in the global market. Currently, it can stably run on over 2,000 device models.
