# Guide of The Shell Solution

For the game security protection program provided by the platform, the user of the command line reinforcement tool
should ensure that the reinforcement operation is the final link of the application or game release. If the user
modifies or packs the reinforced apk or aab file for the second time, The platform will not Liability for any loss or
damage caused by this. Therefore, the platform recommends that users with multi-channel requirements must verify
that the game can run normally if they perform reinforcement operations first and then perform secondary
packaging.

## Suggestion

The following suggestions are provided in combination with current shelling issues and Google Developer
Specifications:

1. Try to ensure that the so files are consistent under each architecture. If a file does not exist under a
   certain architecture, choose to delete or complete it.
2. Try to ensure that the Shelling solutions are not mixed. If there are conflicts, shield the solutions for
   troubleshooting.
3. Try not to upgrade minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion arbitrarily. During the upgrade process, you need
   to refer to relevant guidelines in the official Google documentation.
4. Try not to replace the signing certificate arbitrarily, there is a problem that cannot be installed due to
   overwriting.
5. Try not to select too many so or dll when shelling, so as to avoid the performance impact.
6. The so file protection function requires the shelled so file to contain the .init_array section, if not, contact
   customer service.

## INTRODUCTION

With this tool, The shell solution can be integrated into your continuous integration process and signature
process of game. It can be automatically shelled and signed with one line of code.

**Pay attention:**

1. This tool only supports the Android version of the game.
2. Operating System Supported：Windows / MAC OS / Linux (For Windows and Linux systems, x86 and
   x64 versions are provided separately. Please confirm the operating system configuration of your computer
   before selecting the tool version.)
3. When the tool is running, the game will be authenticated first. The platform will issue a cert format certificate for
   each game. If there is no correct game certificate in your toolkit, please contact customer service.
4. This tool provides two shell: APK-single shell/ AAB-single shell
5. Before calling the tool on the MAC or Linux systems, you should execute the following operations in the
   directory where the tool is located firstly.
   
   ```xml
   cd where_your_mtpclientconsole_dir
   chmod -R 777 ./*
   ```

**Multi-channel attention**

1. if you need to shell several game packages from different application markets, please script by refering to [the example code](#example-code) on the buttom of article to scripting.
2. if you need to make multi-channel package on the shelled game, please use the CUSTOM MODE and cancel the verification of files which modified by channel in the configuration file during shelling.

**DESCRIPTION OF tpshell-config.xml：**

**DESCRIPTION OF config.json：**

Configuration item | Meaning
---|---
TPVersion|Required field, specify shell version number
ToolPath | The tool will depend on the tools directory information in the toolkit.Please fill in the complete absolute path of the tools directory.(Don't add quotes.)
Sign | Optional, the signing certificate information provided by the game developer
keystorePath | the path of the key file, string type (Please fill in the absolute path.)
keyPass | the password of keystore, string type
storePass | the password of repository, string type
aliaName | another name, string type
EncSo | It's the list of .so files you want to encript. Please only select the core files, otherwise game performance will be affected.(Don't add quotes.)
EncDll | It's the list of .dll files you want to encript. Please only select the core files such as Assembly-CSharp.(Don't add quotes.)
enable_globalmetadata_enc | Required field, Only enable global-metadata.dat file encryption when the il2cpp.so file is encrypted, Value is 'true' or 'false';only support in hardened version 2.6 and above.
is_use_application_name | Required field, Whether to use application name as the key, Value is 'true' or 'false';only support in hardened version 2.6 and above.
is_weak_version | Required field, Whether to use compatibility mode, Value is 'true' or 'false';only support in hardened version 3.0 and above.
action | Part of the file check, "+" is checked, "-" is unchecked
selector name | The path of the file which is needed to check. The path can't start or end with "/".You should operate according to the xml hierarchy.

**Pay attention:**

***About TPVersion：**
it is recommended to use the default version from the command-line tool. if you need
to change the version, please contact us.

***About signature：**
if you use local signature, you needn't to upload the certificate and add the certificate informaton. only the
keystorePath, storePass, keyPass, aliaName signature information is filled in, and the command line tool will
keep the same signature version before and after the reinforcement by default; if it is not filled, filled in
incorrectly or the package to be reinforced is not signed It is not signed by default, and the game after
reinforcement needs to be signed manually.Generally speaking, aab packages only use v1 signatures.

***About the list of encrypted files：** if list of EncSo and EncDll are empty or not filled, it will use the background default configuration to encrypt the files such as libmono.so, libil2cpp.so, Assembly-CSharp.dll and Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll.

***About the global-metadata encryption：**
The extparams field is the configuration used to encrypt global-metadata, If you don't need this function, you can directly delete the extparams configuration. the global-metadata encryption function is enabled by default in the latest shell version.

***About hardening keys：**
The is_use_application_name field is used to use the application name as a part of the decryption so key to enhance the defense effect. Considering that some channels will modify the application name and cause the hardening crash, custom configuration is only supported in hardened version 2.6 and above. If it is enabled, only is_use_application_name:true needs to be configured.

***About the resource file list：**
APK Shell Mode, all files are verified by default, and it supports custom configuration verification file range;
App Bundle Shell，the resource files are not verified by default, and it does not support custom configuration verification file range;

***About speed upload：**
this version of the tool has integrated the Extreme Upload feature to streamline
network transfer and increase transfer speed, so you needn't to upload the complete apk file.

***About selecting files for verification：** in FileCheck name, the root node is the default action ("+" is checked, "-" is unchecked). When you need to perform the opposite action from the node, you can add it into the selector attribute.For example, in the configuration file, the assets/bin directory is not selected. When the assets/bin/Data/Managed directory is selected, all the options in it are selected, then deselect the UnityEngine.dll file and System.dll file in it. Select all child files of the assets/bin/Data/Resourses directory. Then deselect all child files of the res/layout directory, only select the check_ permission _layout.xml in it.

## Advanced Features

### Enable global-metadata.dat overall encryption function

Configure the lowest version `3.3.0.17246.oversea` in `tpshell-config.xml` and enable `enable_globalmetadata_enc` and enable `enc_entire_globalmetadata`.

 ```xml
    <TPVersion>3.6.0.7494.oversea</TPVersion>

    <!--Encryption configuration for globalmetadata-->
    <EncSo>libil2cpp.so</EncSo>；
    <extparams>{
        "enable_globalmetadata_enc":true, 
        "enc_entire_globalmetadata":true}
    </extparams>
 ```

### Enable the runtime decryption function of global-metadata.dat

*  Refer to [the global-metadata.dat document](#/doc-center/d144163534f6e0231c4a44ec36f465d59d061a52) 

### Enable the Unity AB resource encryption function

* Refer to [Unity AB Resource Encryption](#/doc-center/ef679ed41c183d469d8eef6f910fb3e8a77991c1)

### Enable the function of signature verification

Configure the minimum version in tpshell-config.xml: 3.3.0.17246.cn, and enable is_use_sign_md5 at the same time (if the game has multiple channels, it is strongly recommended not to enable it)

```xml
<TPVersion>3.6.0.7494.oversea</TPVersion>

<!--Encryption configuration for sign-->
<extparams>{
    <!--apk only-->
   "is_use_sign_md5": true
   }
</extparams>
```

### Enable export table hiding and export table reordering functions

```xml
<TPVersion>3.6.0.7494.oversea</TPVersion>

<extparams>{
   "mergelf3_enc_exports":true, 
   "mergelf3_disorder_imports":true
   }
</extparams>
```

## EXAMPLE CODE

**Pay attention**

Shell involves many io operations, considering the machine cpu and network bandwidth, it is recommended
that the number of processes opened at the same time is no more than 10, and specific numbers can be
adjusted depends on machine performance, a large number of installation packages can be handled in
batches by thread pool.
