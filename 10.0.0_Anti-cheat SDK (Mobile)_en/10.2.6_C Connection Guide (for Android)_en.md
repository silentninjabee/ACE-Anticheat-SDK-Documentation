## Precautions for Connection

<font color="red">The access tutorial only supports SDK version 6.1.11 and above.</font>

```xml
1. Anti-cheat SDK supports Android and iOS but not Windows. When debugging a program on Windows, you can use a macro to isolate the SDK features. When releasing your game on the public network, be sure to enable the macro so that the SDK can work properly;
2. We recommend you consider adding a switch to block third-party libraries if your game is connected to any third-party component. In this way, you can block such libraries to troubleshoot issues.
3. The JAR file related to Anti-cheat SDK cannot be obfuscated (for Android only).
4. The reinforcement solution is a complement to the Anti-cheat solution and can effectively protect the stable running of the SDK. Using both the solutions together can deliver a better protection effect.
```

## Overview

* To connect to the SDK, you need to complete the following steps:

```xml
1. Copy the SDK's dynamic library to the specified project directory based on the OS of the game and the CPU architecture supported by the game.
2. Call the SDK APIs based on the user login information.
3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected.
```

* The following files are required for connecting an Android game developed in C or C++ to the SDK:

```xml
ano.jar
ano_sdk.h
libanogs.so
```

* The following permissions are required:

```xml
<!-- Optional permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

* SDK APIs:

```xml
1. Initialization API: AnoSDKInitEx
2. User login API: AnoSDKSetUserInfo
3. API for switching from foreground to background: AnoSDKOnPause
4. API for switching from background to foreground: AnoSDKOnResume
```

## Connection Directions

### Step 1. Add SDK files to the project

1. Copy the `ano.jar` file in the `sdk_android_c` directory to the `libs` directory in the Android project directory.
2. Copy the `ano_sdk.h` file in the `sdk_android_c` directory to the `jni` directory in the Android project directory.
3. Copy the folders named after CPU architectures (including the `libanogs.so` file) in the `sdk_android_c_lib` directory to the corresponding `jni_` directories in the Android project directory, such as `jni_armeabi` and `jni_x86`. There is no need to copy a folder if the corresponding CPU architecture isn't supported.

#### Project attribute settings

1. In Eclipse, select your game project in **Project Explorer** on the left, right-click and select **Properties** in the pop-up menu, select **Java Build Path** on the left in the **Properties** window, and click **Add JARs** in **Library** to add `ano.jar`.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/26/sdk_Android_c_02.jpg)
2. Select the `ano.jar` file that has been copied to the project directory.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/26/sdk_Android_c_03.jpg)
3. After adding `ano.jar`, select it in **Order and Export**.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/26/sdk_Android_c_04.jpg)
4. Add reference to `libanogs.so` in the place whether the Android project loads the game's .so files and modify the .mk file.

```java
// `libanogs.so` must be loaded before the game's .so files
public class Game{
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("anogs");
        System.loadLibrary("game");
    }
}
```

```makefile
# Add the following code to `jin/Android.mk` to load `libanogs.so`:
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := libtp2
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := $(TARGET_ARCH_ABI)/libanogs.so
include $(PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY)
```

```makefile
# Add the following code to the .so node where the game is located in `jni/Android.mk` to import `libtp2`:
 LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES += libtp2
```

### Step 2. Call SDK APIs

* **Header file**

```c++
include "ano_sdk.h"
```

* **Initialization API**

**Function prototype**

```c++
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) void AnoSDKInitEx(int app_id, const char* app_key);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|--- | -- | --|
|game_id | Yes | `game_id` assigned by ACE |
|app_key | Yes | `game_key` assigned by ACE, which corresponds to `game_id` |

`gameId` and `appKey` will be automatically generated after you register your game in [ACE](#/console/service/overview) and can be viewed in **Service Management** as shown below:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_Anti-cheat%20SDK/30/clipboard_20220126_042604.png)

* **User login API**

**Function prototype**

```c++
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) void AnoSDKSetUserInfo(int account_type, const char *open_id);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|-----|
|account_type | Account type related to the operations platform. You should enter it by referring to `AnoSdkEntryId` below |
|open_id | Unique user ID, which can be a custom string and cannot contain special symbols. It is required if punishment is involved |

For `account_type`, enter `1` for the QQ platform, `2` for the WeChat platform, and `99` for other platforms by default. For values of other mainstream account login platforms in and outside the Chinese mainland, please see below:

```c++
// The login entries of Game Center, Google Play, VK, Kuaishou, and Apple take effect on SDK versions above 4.6
enum AnoSdkEntryId{
	ENTRY_ID_QZONE		= 1,       	// QQ
	ENTRY_ID_MM			= 2,       	// wechat
	ENTRT_ID_FACEBOOK	= 3,		// facebook
	ENTRY_ID_TWITTER	= 4,		// twitter
	ENTRY_ID_LINE		= 5,		// line
	ENTRY_ID_WHATSAPP	= 6,		// whatsapp
	ENTRY_ID_GAMECENTER = 7,		// gamecenter
	ENTRY_ID_GOOGLEPLAY = 8,		// googleplay
	ENTRY_ID_VK         = 9,		// vk
	ENTRY_ID_KUAISHOU	= 10,		// kuaishou
	ENTRY_ID_APPLE		= 11,		// apple
	ENTRY_ID_NEXON		= 12,		// nexon
	ENTRY_ID_NAVER		= 13,		// naver
    ENTRY_ID_GARENA		= 14,		// garena
	ENTRY_ID_HUAWEI		= 15,		// huawei
	ENTRY_ID_RIOT       = 16,       // riot
	ENTRY_ID_NINTENDO   = 17,       // nintendo
	ENTRY_ID_PSN        = 18,       // psn
	ENTRY_ID_MICROSOFT  = 19,       // microsoft
	ENTRY_ID_EA         = 20,       // ea
	ENTRY_ID_CUSTOM     = 21,       // custom
	ENTRY_ID_OTHERS		= 99,		// other platform
}
```

`world_id` is customized by the game. If the game has only one region, you can enter `0`.

`role_id` is used to distinguish between different characters of the same account in the same region. If there is only one character, you can enter "" (null).

`open_id` is assigned by the operations platform of the game and used to uniquely identify a user.

* **API for switching from foreground to background**

**Function prototype**

```c++
// Switch the game to the background
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) void AnoSDKOnPause();
```

* **API for switching from background to foreground**

**Function prototype**

```c++
// Switch the game to the foreground
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) void AnoSDKOnResume();
```

* **Call time sequence**

```xml
`AnoSDKInitEx` should be first called when the game is started, and its parameters are the game ID and `app_key`.
If you call the SDK APIs earlier, you can better protect the game process.

`AnoSDKSetUserInfo` should be called after the game gets the login information authorized by the user.
If there are region IDs and character IDs in the game, call the `AnoSDKSetUserInfo` API after getting the region and character IDs.
During gameplay, if the game is disconnected and connected again, this API needs to be called again to get the user login information for operations such as login again after logout. The parameters passed in are the user account information, which can be customized.

`AnoSDKOnResume` should be called when the game is switched from the background to the foreground.

`AnoSDKOnPause` should be called when the game is switched from the foreground to the background.

Some features of the SDK will stop running if the game is switched to the background. Therefore, this API will affect the normal operations of SDK features.
```

```c++
void game_start() {

    // It is first called when the game is started
    AnoSDKInitEx (9000, "d5ab8dc7ef67ca92e41d730982c5c602");

    // It is called when the user logs in
    int account_type = ENTRY_ID_QZONE;  /*Account type*/
    char open_id[] = "B73B36366565F9E02C752";/*User ID related to the platform*/
    AnoSDKSetUserInfo(account_type, open_id);
};

// Switch the game to the background
void game_pause(){
    AnoSDKOnPause();
}

// Switch the game to the foreground
void game_resume(){
    AnoSDKOnResume();
}
```

### Step 3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected

Precautions for checking SDK connection:

```xml
1. To combat cheats, make sure that the SDK APIs including those for initialization, user login, and foreground/background switch have been called on the game client.
2. Check whether the feature of forced quit based on either-or can be normally used.
```

Directions for checking SDK connection:

1. Use a cheat to check whether the features of forced quit for trainers, speed adjusters, and VMs and either-or work. For the specific effect of cheat defense, please watch [this video](https://v.qq.com/x/page/y0868v09qgj.html) (note: to get the sample cheats used in the video, please contact the customer service).
2. Go to the [data query](#/console/service/query-data) page to check whether the relevant cheating information is displayed (note: there is a 5-minute delay for data display).

## Data Privacy Compliance APIs

**Though cheats are less likely to happen in some games, they can be exposed to data privacy compliance risks arising from the SDK. Using data privacy compliance APIs in SDK 5.9.20 and above, you can disable anti-cheat data collection and anti-cheat of the SDK, reducing data collection and improving data privacy compliance.**

#### (Optional) Disabling data collection for Android devices with the API

The API is provided to configure the SDK to not collect data you want to protect from the Android device. You can call the API as needed.

The SDK can be configured to not collect the following information: the device screen resolution, SD card path, files path in the SD card, CPU name, application debugging status, application certificate, certificate author, certificate environment, CPU model, device manufacturer, device model, and VPN status.

***Function prototype***

```cpp
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) uintptr_t AnoSDKIoctl(int request, const
char *param_str);
```

***Parameter description***

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|----|
|request | The fixed value is `AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery`.|
|param | Specifies what information will not be collected. `NULL` is not allowed.|

The values of `param` are shown in the table below. To not collect the information you want to protect, you can perform the bitwise OR operation (|) on the corresponding parameter value to calculate a hex integer, and pass the value formatted in "CloseDevInfoCollect: 0x%x" to `param`.

For example: To not collect all information, enter cmd="CloseDevInfoCollect:0xfff". To not collect the screen resolution, manufacturer, and model of the device, then enter cmd="CloseDevInfoCollect:0x601".

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ---- | ----- | -----|
| 0x00000001 | Screen resolution of the device | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000002 | Path of the SD card | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000004 | Files path in the SD card | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000008 | CPU name | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000010 | Debugging status of the application | The SDK capability to detect debuggers such as IDA will be reduced. |
| 0x00000020 | Certificate of the application | The SDK will fail to detect the cracked versions. |
| 0x00000040 | Author of the application’s certificate | The SDK will fail to detect the cracked versions. |
| 0x00000080 | Environment of the application’s certificate | The SDK capability to detect the cracked versions will be reduced. |
| 0x00000100 | CPU model | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000200 | Manufacturer of the device | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000400 | Device model | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000800 | VPN status | The SDK capability to detect the suspicious network will be reduced. |

***When to call the function***

Make an API call right after the SDK initialization API is called. The call can also be made before players log in. The project team needs to additionally call the 'AnoSDKFree' function to release memory, otherwise there will be memory leaks

```csharp

private void Awake () {
    // Disable the collection of all information.
     AnoSdkAntiDataInfo* info0 = (AnoSdkAntiDataInfo*)AnoSDKIoctl(AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery,"CloseDevInfoCollect:0xfff");
      if(info0 != NULL){
        AnoSDKFree(info0);
     }
     // Disable the collection of the screen resolution, manufacturer, and model of the device.
     AnoSdkAntiDataInfo* info1 = (AnoSdkAntiDataInfo*)AnoSDKIoctl(AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery,"CloseDevInfoCollect:0x601");
      if(info1 != NULL){
        AnoSDKFree(info0);
     }
      // Disable the collection of the CPU name, certificate of the application and CPU model.
    AnoSdkAntiDataInfo* info2 = (AnoSdkAntiDataInfo*)AnoSDKIoctl(AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery,"CloseDevInfoCollect:0x128");
      if(info2 != NULL){
        AnoSDKFree(info2);
     }
}
```

#### (Optional) Disabling specific scanning with the API

The API is provided to configure the SDK to not collect data from specific scanning. When cheats are less likely to happen in the game application, you can call the API as needed.

The SDK can be configured to disable scanning of the following items: the installed applications (Android), device environment (Android + iOS), emulator (Android + iOS), resource profiler (Android), and cloud phone (Android + iOS).

***Function prototype***

```cpp
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) uintptr_t AnoSDKIoctl(int request, const
char *param_str);
```

***Parameter description***

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|----|
|request | The fixed value is `AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery`.|
|param | Specifies the SDK scanning feature to be disabled. `NULL` is not allowed.|

The values of `param` are shown in the table below.

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| CloseAPKCollect | Scans the applications installed on the Android device. | The SDK capability to detect cheats will be reduced. |
| CloseUserTagScan | Scans the device environment. | After it is disabled, the device environment of the SDK cannot be detected, such as whether it is rooted or jailbroken. |
| CloseEmulatorScan | Scans the emulator environment. | The SDK capability to scan the emulator will be disabled. |
| CloseAntiProfiler | Disables defense capabilities of the resource profiler. | The SDK capability to detect and protect the resource profiler will be disabled. |
| CloseCloudPhoneScan | Scans the cloud phone environment. | The SDK capability to detect the cloud phone will be disabled. |

***When to call the function***

Make an API call before the SDK initialization API is called. In addition, The project team needs to additionally call the 'AnoSDKFree' function to release memory, otherwise there will be memory leaks

```csharp

private void Awake () {
    //Disable the collection of the installed applications.
     AnoSdkAntiDataInfo* info0 = (AnoSdkAntiDataInfo*)AnoSDKIoctl(AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery,"CloseAPKCollect");
      if(info0 != NULL){
        AnoSDKFree(info0);
     }
    //Disable the collection of the device environment.
    AnoSdkAntiDataInfo* info1 = (AnoSdkAntiDataInfo*)AnoSDKIoctl(AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery,"CloseUserTagScan");
      if(info1 != NULL){
        AnoSDKFree(info1);
     }
     //Disable the scanning of the emulator.
     AnoSdkAntiDataInfo* info2 = (AnoSdkAntiDataInfo*)AnoSDKIoctl(AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery,"CloseEmulatorScan");
      if(info2 != NULL){
        AnoSDKFree(info2);
     }
     //Disable the defense capabilities of the resource profiler.
     AnoSdkAntiDataInfo* info3 = (AnoSdkAntiDataInfo*)AnoSDKIoctl(AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery,"CloseAntiProfiler");
      if(info3 != NULL){
        AnoSDKFree(info3);
     }
    //Disable the scanning of the cloud phone.
    AnoSdkAntiDataInfo* info4 = (AnoSdkAntiDataInfo*)AnoSDKIoctl(AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery,"CloseCloudPhoneScan");
      if(info4 != NULL){
        AnoSDKFree(info4);
     }
}
```

#### (Optional) Enable the collection of the installed applications.

**For privacy compliance,<font color="#dd0000">Based on SDK5.9.27 and SDK6.1.7 and above, the security SDK disables the application installation list scanning function on Android devices by default, While improving privacy compliance, the pulg-in detection ability of some functions of the security SDK is reduced</font>**

**Against this background,The security SDK provides an interface to enable the scanning function of the application installation list on the Android device. The project team with a high risk of plug-in can actively inform the user and declare the permission to obtain the user's application list based on the actual needs.By calling this interface, the SDK's application installation list scanning function is enabled, which greatly improves the SDK's plug-in detection capability.**

***Function prototype***

```cpp
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) uintptr_t AnoSDKIoctl(int request, const
char *param_str);
```

***Parameter description***

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|----|
|request | The fixed value is `AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery`.|
|param | "AllowAPKCollect"|

For example: To enable application list scanning on Android devices, enter param="AllowAPKCollect". 

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| AllowAPKCollect | Enable the scanning function of the application installation list on the Android device | The SDK capability to detect cheats will be improved.|

***When to call the function***

Make an API call before the SDK initialization API is called. In addition, The project team needs to additionally call the 'AnoSDKFree' function to release memory, otherwise there will be memory leaks

```csharp

private void Awake () {
    //Enable the collection of the installed applications.
      AnoSdkAntiDataInfo* info = (AnoSdkAntiDataInfo*)AnoSDKIoctl(AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery,"AllowAPKCollect");
      if(info != NULL){
        AnoSDKFree(info);
     }
}
```
